## Starbound-Wiki
Welcome to the wiki for the Starbound-Proxy! This [wiki](../../wiki) provides an overview of the various commands available through the proxy and the vanilla game. 

### What is a proxy?
Usually, when you play online, your game talks directly to the server to send and receive information. But with a proxy, it acts as an intermediary between your game client and the game server. It reads packets of data sent between the two and can modify, enhance, or control the communication.
